## Rust Control Flow 04 

### Handling `if` expression

```
fn main(){

    let number = 3 ; 
    
    if number < 5 {
        println!("condition was true");
    }else {
        println!("condition was false");
    }
}
```

### Handling `else if` expression

```
fn main() {
    let number = 6;

    if number % 4 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 4");
    } else if number % 3 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 3");
    } else if number % 2 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 2");
    } else {
        println!("number is not divisible by 4, 3, or 2");
    }
}
```

### Using if in a let Statement

``` 
fn main(){
    let condition = true ; 
    let number = if condition { 5 } else { 6 } ;
    
    println!("The value of number is : {number}");
}
```

### Using `loop`

``` 
fn main() {
    let mut counter = 0;

    let result = loop {
        counter += 1;

        if counter == 10 {
            break counter * 2;
        }
    };

    println!("The result is {result}");
}
```
